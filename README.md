Using GoogleApiClient and LocationListener

*Google Play provides the fused location provider to retrieve the deviceâ€™s last known location

*LocationListener Used for receiving notifications from the LocationManager when the location has changed. These methods are called if the LocationListener has been registered with the location manager service using the requestLocationUpdates(String, long, float, LocationListener) method. 

To use the location manager make the Google play service available via your app build.gradle file.
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:11.0.0'
    }
    
Also specify the following required permission in your manifest.
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
    <!-- includes permission only for NETWORK_PROVIDER. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <!-- includes permission both for NETWORK_PROVIDER and GPS_PROVIDER. -->
    
If you want to access the GPS sensor, you need the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission. 
Otherwise you need the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission
